We develop industry leading cross-\ndevice graphs by leveraging identity signals from petabytes of data and applying these \nsignals in real time across a trillion ad opportunities per day. The Identity team also \ndevelops and maintains Unified ID 2.0, a privacy-conscious, secure, and accurate identity \nstandard for the entire digital advertising ecosystem.\nOur Software Engineers are end-to-end owners who have the opportunity to participate in \nmany aspects of designing, building, and delivering data-focused products for our \nstakeholders.\nAt The Trade Desk, we believe in building the backend infrastructure of our platform with a\nfocus on quality at scale. Whether we are building parts of our client-facing applications, \ninternal custom solutions for our own team members, or model pipelines for bidding \noptimizations, we are making sure that we have infrastructure, development, and tools to \ndo it right and efficiently.\nOur system performs every day, 24/7, serving global traffic. We build distributed systems in\na highly collaborative environment, utilizing a broad range of technologies. Our backend \ndevelopers work on finding solutions to algorithmic, optimization, and scale challenges in \neverything we do.\nWhat you’ll do:\nSome of the work that you will be doing to help us deliver on our mission is:\nDesign, build, deliver, and own full lifecycle development software from inception to \nproduction\nDevelop and maintain highly available distributed systems with high throughput and \nlow latency requirements\nDevelop and maintain reliable and efficient big data pipelines\nDeliver quality changes, including automated tests, metrics, and monitoring\nCollaborate with team members to deliver features\nCollaborate with product managers, data scientists and business stakeholders to \nunderstand and drive business outcomes\nGuide and review changes to product features in line with product roadmaps\nLead others through example, mentorship, teaching, and/or participate in hiring \nactivities\nWe are a global team with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. To \ncomplement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be \n        \nwell-versed in building from common ground to value, seek out, and foster invisible and \nvisible dimensions of diversity.\nWho you are:\nOur culture is much deeper than just having fun together (though we do that well, too). We \ntake pride in our engineers being trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, \nand gritty pursuers of excellence. You do not have to meet all the requirements below, but \nwe believe that people who meet most of them will have a higher likelihood of succeeding \nin this role:\nYou are comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time \nzones and continents.\nYou are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical \naudiences.\nYou have a solid understanding of computer science and engineering fundamentals.\nYou are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: C#, Java, \nC++, Python, or Scala.\nYou have experience working with distributed systems.\nYou have experience working with large scale data processing pipelines.\nYou have 3+ years of software development engineering experience.\nYou have additional nice-to-have experience in the following areas: Spark, Airflow, \nKubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Aerospike, SQL Server, Vertica, Kafka, \nFlink\nYou have a Bachelor’s/Master’s level degree in computer science or relevant \nengineering-related field or equivalent experience. Not everyone has the same level of \naccess to opportunities. What is most important to us is what and how you can \ncontribute, which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you \nhave.\nA variety of technical opportunities is one of the best things about working at The Trade\nDesk as a software engineer, which is why we do not expect you to know every \ntechnology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and\nfind solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job. What you know \nis less important than how well you learn and innovate. We are not seeking engineers \nwho know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent answers no one has \nthought of yet and find answers to the questions yet to be asked",
