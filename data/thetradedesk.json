          "value": "What we do:\nOptimization: How do we decide what ads to show to who and when to maximize the return on investment for an advertising campaign? How do we apply that decision making algorithm 11 million times per second, for thousands of advertising campaigns at once?\nForecasting: Can we predict with confidence how many people will be reached by an advertising campaign, and how much it will cost to reach them? Can we do that months in advance?\nExperimental design: How do we measure the impact of any changes we introduce to our optimization models? How do we quantify any tradeoffs those models may introduce (e.g., you pay more for each ad impression, but each impression is more valuable)?\nCausal inference: How do we determine what ads are performing best? What does it mean to have a high performing campaign? (Hint: clicks aren't the answer!)\nMachine Learning: How can we predict demographic information or interest of a given user by natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\nOwn a meaningful project. Have the opportunity to contribute to the development of new and existing data products, experiencing firsthand the day-to-day life of a professional data scientist. We believe strongly in ownership at The Trade Desk, and we are committed to you having something substantial to show for your time here that will make a positive impact for the team.\nReceive one-on-one mentorship from an experienced Data Scientist and members of the Data Science team.\nCollaborate with a globally-connected team where you will also interact closely with our product, trading, and engineering teams to oversee the implementation of your projects.\n\nWho you are:\nYou might be a great fit for a Data Science internship at The Trade Desk if you\nAre enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies, machine learning techniques, and advancements in the AdTech industry.\nHave an abundance of intellectual curiosity.\nHave a deep understanding of statistical machine learning and optimization techniques.\nWant to work with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS.\nHave experience in at least one programming language (Python, R, Java, Scala, etc.) and are comfortable with SQL by the start of the internship.\nAre able to deliver a convincing story, derived from data, to both technical and non-technical audiences.\nAre enrolled in a Master's or PhD degree program.\nHave an expected graduation date between Fall 2024 and Summer 2025.\nCan work in our Shanghai office for the duration of your internship. \n\nWhat you’re looking for:\n\nDo you want to work on a meaningful and impactful project that makes a difference?

With a media buying platform that helps brands deliver a more insightful and relevant ad experience for consumers –– and sets a new standard for global reach, accuracy, and transparency. We are proud of the culture we have built. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.  \n\nSo, if you are talented, driven, creative, and eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team, then we want to talk!  \n\nWHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:  \n\nServe as the technical and strategic lead for a portfolio of top-tier CPG clients and agencies, helping them architect high-impact programmatic strategies that align with both brand and business objectives. \nDesign and implement long-term platform adoption roadmaps, tying together identity solutions, data partnerships, measurement frameworks, and retail media activations across global markets. \nLead strategic planning and technical solutioning for complex use cases involving custom audiences (e.g., UPC, SKU-level), data clean rooms, advanced measurement (e.g., incrementality, sales lift), and omnichannel execution. \nPartner with internal product, data, and engineering teams to shape feature development and integrations that address CPG-specific challenges, such as closed-loop measurement, retailer co-op compliance, geo-fenced attribution, and cross-retailer optimization. \nAnalyze campaign performance using SQL, Python, Looker, or other BI tools, and use that data to drive insight-driven business reviews, optimization frameworks, and experimentation plans. \nDevelop tailored strategies for media mix modeling (MMM) alignment, first-party data onboarding, and retail media integrations that support both upper- and lower-funnel goals. \nAct as a technical translator between business and product teams—communicating platform capabilities and limitations in context of the client’s martech stack and organizational priorities. \nEstablish yourself as a thought partner and trusted advisor to VP and C-suite level stakeholders across client and agency organizations. \nLead knowledge-sharing initiatives internally and externally, including building vertical-specific playbooks, technical documentation, and omnichannel activation guides for CPG use cases. \nCoach and mentor junior team members in advanced platform capabilities, measurement theory, and client storytelling. \nExtract and synthesize actionable insights from advertiser data using advanced analytics, then translate those findings into tailored, brand-specific narratives and strategic recommendations that drive growth and platform adoption on The Trade Desk. \n\n \n\nWHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:  \n\nBachelor’s degree in a technical or analytical field (e.g., Engineering, Math, Computer Science, Marketing Analytics); Master’s degree is a plus. \n7+ years of adtech or martech experience, including DSPs, DMPs, CDPs, or measurement/identity platforms, with 4+ years supporting CPG advertisers or their agencies in a strategic or solutions-focused role. \nDeep expertise in CPG marketing challenges — from fragmented retailer data to SKU-level targeting, seasonal demand patterns, and shopper marketing ROI. \nHands-on technical experience with campaign optimization, data ingestion workflows, and data transformation using SQL, Python, or APIs. \nUnderstanding of clean room technologies (e.g., Snowflake, LiveRamp Safe Haven, Amazon Marketing Cloud)and their application in CPG use cases. \nDemonstrated experience aligning MMM, MTA, lift studies, and platform-based measurement into a unified performance narrative. \nFluency in identity resolution strategies (e.g., UID2, hashed PII, retailer IDs) and how they influence CPG personalization and targeting at scale. \nExperience advising on data governance, privacy regulations, and how these intersect with global CPG campaigns and audience strategies. \nProven ability to influence product roadmaps and prioritize technical solutions that scale across large, matrixed organizations. \nExceptional communication skills and executive presence; able to translate technical concepts to senior stakeholders across marketing, IT, data science, and procurement. \nHigh intellectual curiosity and an eagerness to solve ambiguous, system-level challenges with cross-functional partners. \nProficiency in SQL and advanced Excel, with a proven ability to analyze large, complex data sets and extract meaningful insights. Skilled in building scalable, automated dashboards and reporting frameworks that translate raw data into strategic intelligence and inform product innovation. \n\nPreferred Qualifications: \n\nExperience integrating with or building retail media and shopper data partnerships (e.g., Kroger Precision Marketing, Roundel, Walmart Connect). \nPrevious roles in technical consulting, solutions architecture, or platform strategy at a DSP, CDP, cloud provider, or enterprise analytics company. \nPublished thought leadership or speaking engagements within the CPG marketing, adtech, or analytics space. \n\n  \n\nThe Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.
