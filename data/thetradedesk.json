          "value": "What we do:\nOptimization: How do we decide what ads to show to who and when to maximize the return on investment for an advertising campaign? How do we apply that decision making algorithm 11 million times per second, for thousands of advertising campaigns at once?\nForecasting: Can we predict with confidence how many people will be reached by an advertising campaign, and how much it will cost to reach them? Can we do that months in advance?\nExperimental design: How do we measure the impact of any changes we introduce to our optimization models? How do we quantify any tradeoffs those models may introduce (e.g., you pay more for each ad impression, but each impression is more valuable)?\nCausal inference: How do we determine what ads are performing best? What does it mean to have a high performing campaign? (Hint: clicks aren't the answer!)\nMachine Learning: How can we predict demographic information or interest of a given user by natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\nOwn a meaningful project. Have the opportunity to contribute to the development of new and existing data products, experiencing firsthand the day-to-day life of a professional data scientist. We believe strongly in ownership at The Trade Desk, and we are committed to you having something substantial to show for your time here that will make a positive impact for the team.\nReceive one-on-one mentorship from an experienced Data Scientist and members of the Data Science team.\nCollaborate with a globally-connected team where you will also interact closely with our product, trading, and engineering teams to oversee the implementation of your projects.\n\nWho you are:\nYou might be a great fit for a Data Science internship at The Trade Desk if you\nAre enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies, machine learning techniques, and advancements in the AdTech industry.\nHave an abundance of intellectual curiosity.\nHave a deep understanding of statistical machine learning and optimization techniques.\nWant to work with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS.\nHave experience in at least one programming language (Python, R, Java, Scala, etc.) and are comfortable with SQL by the start of the internship.\nAre able to deliver a convincing story, derived from data, to both technical and non-technical audiences.\nAre enrolled in a Master's or PhD degree program.\nHave an expected graduation date between Fall 2024 and Summer 2025.\nCan work in our Shanghai office for the duration of your internship. \n\nWhat you’re looking for:\n\nDo you want to work on a meaningful and impactful project that makes a difference? Are you eager to innovate? Do you want unique, large-scale, and highly complex challenges involving technology that is brand-new to you?\n\nWhat and how you can contribute is what’s important to us.

You’ll work closely with cross-functional partners to deliver meaningful business outcomes while growing leaders and strengthening team culture. \n\nWhat we do: \n\nWe trust our engineering managers to grow, empower, and support our greatest asset, our people. At The Trade Desk, every opportunity to engage internal and external stakeholders is unique. \n\nIn this role, you will manage teams responsible for developing custom solutions and strategic integrations for our major clients. You will partner across Engineering, Product, Business Development, and Technical Account Management to incorporate stakeholder needs and drive strategic outcomes.
