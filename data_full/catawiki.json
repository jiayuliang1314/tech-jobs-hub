At Catawiki, we’re redefining how high-value, collector-grade vehicles are discovered, evaluated, and sold online. We&#39;re a tight-knit, high-performing team of automotive experts based in the Netherlands and Italy, and we’re on the lookout for someone who’s not only passionate about cars but driven by commercial impact. This role is not just about admiring classic cars; it&#39;s about making them move.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Classic Car Expert, you’ll be working with high-value lots and a targeted, specific buyer audience. We’re obsessed with quality and detail, whether it&#39;s a rare Alfa Romeo or a perfectly preserved Porsche.

But beyond the passion, we also know what matters most: getting the deal done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We combine expertise with execution. We help sellers present their cars in the best possible way, but we don’t just &quot;list and hope.&quot; We screen every lot with a commercial lens, we push for promotional and themed auctions, and we ask ourselves: &lt;em&gt;Will this sell?

You’ll bring your own network and build trust with new clients, staying sharp on market trends and spotting what’s next before it hits the mainstream. From fairs and local events to one-on-one phone calls, your day will be a mix of deep automotive conversation and smart sales thinking. It’s a dynamic, hybrid environment where autonomy meets teamwork, and if the opportunity arises, we even meet in person to keep the energy high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the challenges?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;We operate in a fast-moving space, and not every lot is a guaranteed success. Our challenge is to build curated auctions that excite buyers, create urgency, and convert. We’re also building bridges between digital and traditional — helping sellers and buyers trust an online auction model for high-value vehicles. That means being responsive, professional, and always ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In short, we&#39;re car lovers, but even more — we’re deal makers!

At Catawiki, we’re redefining how high-value, collector-grade vehicles are discovered, evaluated, and sold online. We&#39;re a tight-knit, high-performing team of automotive experts based in the Netherlands and Italy, and we’re on the lookout for someone who’s not only passionate about cars but driven by commercial impact. This role is not just about admiring classic cars — it&#39;s about making them move.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Sr. Classic Car Expert, you’ll be working with high-value lots and a targeted, specific buyer audience. We’re obsessed with quality and detail, whether it&#39;s a rare Alfa Romeo or a perfectly preserved Porsche. Each of us brings deep brand knowledge — some of us breathe Italian heritage, others know the German precision scene like the back of their hand. But beyond the passion, we also know what matters most: getting the deal done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We combine expertise with execution. We help sellers present their cars in the best possible way, but we don’t just &quot;list and hope.&quot; We screen every lot with a commercial lens, we push for promotional and themed auctions, and we ask ourselves: &lt;em&gt;Will this sell? And to whom?&lt;/em&gt; If we don’t have the answer, we ask each other — because we trust our collective knowledge more than any tool. That collaboration fuels our performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes this role exciting?&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll focus on growing the category through new leads from currently unsupported and/or underserved markets and by reactivating dormant sellers. You’ll bring your own network and build trust with new clients, staying sharp on market trends and spotting what’s next before it hits the mainstream. From fairs and local events to one-on-one phone calls, your day will be a mix of deep automotive conversation and smart sales thinking. It’s a dynamic, hybrid environment where autonomy meets teamwork — and if the opportunity arises, we even meet in person to keep the energy high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the challenges?&lt;/strong&gt; We operate in a fast-moving space, and not every lot is a guaranteed success. Our challenge is to build curated auctions that excite buyers, create urgency, and convert. We’re also building bridges between digital and traditional — helping sellers and buyers trust an online auction model for high-value vehicles. That means being responsive, professional, and always ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In short: we&#39;re car lovers, but even more — we’re deal makers. If you can tell the story behind a car, but also sell it with conviction... if you’re comfortable working with targets and inspired by international growth... if you&#39;re ready to bring your own spark to a strong team — then you might be the one we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Untapped Markets&lt;/strong&gt;: Proactively pursue new leads from unsupported or underserved countries, turning them into active seller portfolios and opening new commercial frontiers for Catawiki’s classic car category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revive and Grow Seller Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Grow existing seller portfolios and re-engage past sellers by leveraging your automotive expertise, sales instinct, and a personalized approach to relationship management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver Commercial Results:&lt;/strong&gt; You work confidently with targets and are motivated by outcomes. You leverage your personal network to secure high-value cars and commercial deals that contribute directly to GMV.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curate High-Quality Auctions&lt;/strong&gt;: You screen incoming lots with care and commercial focus, ensuring auctions are filled with cars that resonate with our buyer audience — both in quality and story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Story-Driven Auctions:&lt;/strong&gt; You bring creativity to the table by proposing themed auctions and promotional lots, using storytelling and strategic thinking to attract new interest and deepen buyer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Cross-Category Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; While your focus is classic cars, you’re ready to support the motorcycle category when needed — contributing your insight and energy to help the broader automotive team succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who You Are&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a fluent French or German speaker, and preferably professional level of spoken Dutch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Activator&lt;/strong&gt;: You bring a strong personal network of sellers, collectors, and dealers to Catawiki, expanding our supply of high-quality classic cars and unlocking new commercial opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales-First Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;: You love beautiful cars, but you know this is a business — you focus on selling, not just showcasing.

You understand the vehicles, but you also understand what makes them sell — and you act on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where You’ll Be&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role is based in France or Germany, with a work-from-home arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;text text-align-left &quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why You&#39;ll Love Working with Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Visible Impact&lt;/strong&gt; by working at scale in a global organisation that serves millions of customers across 80+ categories.

Each week we offer over 75,000 unique items in auction&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; carefully curated by our passionate in-house experts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having sold over 20 million unique objects to date, we’re on a mission to become the world’s most popular destination for special objects. As a growing, diverse and sustainable scale-up, we proudly live by our core values:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Taking ownership and driving impact&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being open to change and feedback&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being passionate about our mission and our customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If these values resonate with you, we’d love to explore how you can join us on this exciting journey!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role and team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel the Future of Classic Car Sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional cars deserve exceptional treatment&lt;/strong&gt; — and that’s where we come in. At Catawiki, we’re redefining how high-value, collector-grade vehicles are discovered, evaluated, and sold online. We&#39;re a tight-knit, high-performing team of automotive experts based in the Netherlands and Italy, and we’re on the lookout for someone who’s not only passionate about cars but driven by commercial impact. This role is not just about admiring classic cars — it&#39;s about making them move.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Sr. Classic Car Expert, you’ll be working with high-value lots and a targeted, specific buyer audience. We’re obsessed with quality and detail, whether it&#39;s a rare Alfa Romeo or a perfectly preserved Porsche. Each of us brings deep brand knowledge — some of us breathe Italian heritage, others know the German precision scene like the back of their hand. But beyond the passion, we also know what matters most: getting the deal done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We combine expertise with execution. We help sellers present their cars in the best possible way, but we don’t just &quot;list and hope.&quot; We screen every lot with a commercial lens, we push for promotional and themed auctions, and we ask ourselves: &lt;em&gt;Will this sell? And to whom?&lt;/em&gt; If we don’t have the answer, we ask each other — because we trust our collective knowledge more than any tool. That collaboration fuels our performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes this role exciting?&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll focus on growing the category through new leads from currently unsupported and/or underserved markets and by reactivating dormant sellers. You’ll bring your own network and build trust with new clients, staying sharp on market trends and spotting what’s next before it hits the mainstream. From fairs and local events to one-on-one phone calls, your day will be a mix of deep automotive conversation and smart sales thinking. It’s a dynamic, hybrid environment where autonomy meets teamwork — and if the opportunity arises, we even meet in person to keep the energy high.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the challenges?&lt;/strong&gt; We operate in a fast-moving space, and not every lot is a guaranteed success. Our challenge is to build curated auctions that excite buyers, create urgency, and convert. We’re also building bridges between digital and traditional — helping sellers and buyers trust an online auction model for high-value vehicles. That means being responsive, professional, and always ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In short: we&#39;re car lovers, but even more — we’re deal makers. If you can tell the story behind a car, but also sell it with conviction... if you’re comfortable working with targets and inspired by international growth... if you&#39;re ready to bring your own spark to a strong team — then you might be the one we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You’ll Do&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand Untapped Markets&lt;/strong&gt;: Proactively pursue new leads from unsupported or underserved countries, turning them into active seller portfolios and opening new commercial frontiers for Catawiki’s classic car category.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revive and Grow Seller Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Grow existing seller portfolios and re-engage past sellers by leveraging your automotive expertise, sales instinct, and a personalized approach to relationship management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver Commercial Results:&lt;/strong&gt; You work confidently with targets and are motivated by outcomes.

Your team is responsible for offering cheaper and better ways of shipping sold items from sellers to buyers - and we are starting to offer new shipping methods in many more countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Logistics team, like all our Engineering teams, is interdisciplinary: you will cooperate directly with Backend, Frontend, iOS, and Android Engineers, and together you are responsible for all shipping and logistics functionality of our Catawiki apps and our web app. You will create software that helps both our buyers and our sellers to optimise their delivery workflow. Apart from the Engineers, your other team members include the QA, UX Designer, Product Manager, and your Tech Lead Manager, who leads and guides the Engineers on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other Engineering team members, you will build beautiful and adaptable web frontends on top of scalable microservices. Most of these serve our sellers and buyers, and some are geared towards our own customer services and internal operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You ensure that your web components work well and are responsive to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. By measuring and monitoring system performance, you optimise the performance of your products.&lt;br&gt;In addition, you will use A/B experiments, agreed upon with your Product Manager and User Experience Designer, and backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are a &lt;em&gt;Front-end Engineer&lt;/em&gt; with extensive frontend experience in multiple technologies, with an impressive portfolio of past frontend deliveries, and eager to expand your knowledge and impact, ready to take the next step in your career. As a Senior Developer, you are effective in lifting the level of your team, and you love to cooperate with Front-end Engineers of other teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a passionate engineer with a strong eye for detail.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You strive to be a great team player and don’t shy away from new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are someone who takes initiative and is ready to jump in and help if needed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You keep the company&#39;s values close to your heart.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You enjoy working in a diverse and dynamic environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are passionate about what you do and eager to follow industry trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You possess a &quot;Growth Mindset&quot; in which you take the initiative to further your personal skill set as a Software Developer, whether by learning new skills and/or technologies or by seeking new opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have an Experimental Mindset: we value a test-and-learn approach - validate ideas quickly, iterate based on insights, and don’t be afraid to discard what doesn’t work. Once validated, we build for the long term with scalability and maintainability in mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We look for Engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges.

Your team is responsible for offering cheaper and better ways of shipping sold items from sellers to buyers - and we are starting to offer new shipping methods in many more countries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Logistics team, like all our Engineering teams, is interdisciplinary: you will cooperate directly with Backend, Frontend, iOS, and Android Engineers, and together you are responsible for all shipping and logistics functionality of our Catawiki apps and our web app. You will create software that helps both our buyers and our sellers to optimise their delivery workflow. Apart from the Engineers, your other team members include the QA, UX Designer, Product Manager, and your Tech Lead Manager, who leads and guides the Engineers on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other Engineering team members, you will build beautiful and adaptable web frontends on top of scalable microservices. Most of these serve our sellers and buyers, and some are geared towards our own customer services and internal operations teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You ensure that your web components work well and are responsive to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. By measuring and monitoring system performance, you optimise the performance of your products.&lt;br&gt;In addition, you will use A/B experiments, agreed upon with your Product Manager and User Experience Designer, and backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are a &lt;em&gt;Front-end Engineer&lt;/em&gt; with extensive frontend experience in multiple technologies, with an impressive portfolio of past frontend deliveries, and eager to expand your knowledge and impact, ready to take the next step in your career. As a Senior Developer, you are effective in lifting the level of your team, and you love to cooperate with Front-end Engineers of other teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are a passionate engineer with a strong eye for detail.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You strive to be a great team player and don’t shy away from new challenges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are someone who takes initiative and is ready to jump in and help if needed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You keep the company&#39;s values close to your heart.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You enjoy working in a diverse and dynamic environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are passionate about what you do and eager to follow industry trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You possess a &quot;Growth Mindset&quot; in which you take the initiative to further your personal skill set as a Software Developer, whether by learning new skills and/or technologies or by seeking new opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have an Experimental Mindset: we value a test-and-learn approach - validate ideas quickly, iterate based on insights, and don’t be afraid to discard what doesn’t work. Once validated, we build for the long term with scalability and maintainability in mind.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We look for Engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our front-end stack is mainly built using &lt;strong&gt;TypeScript&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ReactJS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Additionally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;minimum of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;7 years&lt;/strong&gt; of experience&lt;/span&gt; as a Front-End Engineer using JavaScript/TypeScript as your main stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven experience working in product companies and&amp;nbsp;collaborating closely with other engineers and product managers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in designing, implementing, and deploying services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and consistency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are proficient in web technologies - JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are familiar with popular libraries like ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, CSS Modules, Tailwind, and/or Rails.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You understand the browser environment and how it interprets code - HTTP/S, Critical Render Path, CORS, Caching, CDNs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have an understanding of good programming principles - SOLID, DRY - and have a good problem-solving approach and mindset.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When building features, you consider A11y, security, SEO, performance, testing, observability, i18n, and Typing (if applicable).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You know how to monitor and manage an application in production: you build it, you run it, you love it!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Bonus Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While this is a frontend position, familiarity with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;NodeJS&lt;/strong&gt; and experience running it in production is a great plus. This knowledge will help in collaborating effectively across the stack and optimising frontend-backend interactions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;In return&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul class=&quot;p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet&quot; data-stringify-type=&quot;unordered-list&quot; data-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;A competitive&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Annual Gross Base Salary&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;depending on your level, competencies, and overall experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li data-stringify-indent=&quot;0&quot; data-stringify-border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Commuting&lt;/span&gt; between your home and our office is covered by Catawiki.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Amazing&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Office&lt;/span&gt; right in the centre of Amsterdam.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;text text-align-left &quot;&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why You&#39;ll Love Working with Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Visible Impact&lt;/strong&gt; by working at scale in a global organisation that serves millions of customers across 80+ categories.

We’re a passionate, diverse and collaborative team of 800+ Catawikains and 60+ nationalities, all coming together to build a one-of-a-kind marketplace. We foster an inclusive and queer-friendly work environment, committed to making every Catawikian feel welcomed and empowered.

When you join us, you’ll receive a €100 Catavoucher, and on each birthday, you&#39;ll get a €50 Catavoucher to celebrate. Enjoy an extra day off each year to &quot;Pursue Your Passion&quot;. We also recognise significant work anniversaries (3, 5, 8, 10 years) with additional time off, plus extra leave for life’s big moments like marriage, engagements, or moving house.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that benefits can vary by location.
