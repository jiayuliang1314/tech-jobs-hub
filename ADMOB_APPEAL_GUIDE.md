### **模板B：如果你不确定原因（诚实表达困惑）**

Dear AdMob Team,

I have carefully reviewed my app's traffic data but have been unable to identify specific suspicious IP addresses or patterns that would explain the invalid activity detection.

1. TRAFFIC OVERVIEW:
   - App name: [应用名称]
   - Platform: [Android/iOS]
   - Active users: [大约数量]
   - Geographic distribution: [主要地区]
   
2. MY ANALYSIS:
   Unfortunately, I do not have access to detailed click-level data as I was using AdMob as my only analytics platform. However, I have reviewed:
   
   - Google Analytics (basic tracking): No obvious anomalies in user behavior
   - App Store traffic sources: Primarily organic search and featured listings
   - User reviews: No complaints or unusual patterns
   
3. POSSIBLE CAUSES (Speculation):
   While I cannot pinpoint specific IPs, potential issues may include:
   
   a) Accidental clicks:
      - My app has a [类型] interface that may have led to accidental ad clicks
      - Ad placement may have been too close to functional buttons
   
   b) Testing during development:
      - I may have inadvertently clicked ads during testing
      - Did not properly implement test device IDs
   
   c) Organic traffic spike:
      - App was featured on [平台] on [日期]
      - Resulted in unusual traffic volume that may have appeared suspicious
   
4. ACTIONS TAKEN TO PREVENT FUTURE ISSUES:
   Even without identifying the exact cause, I have:
   
   - Redesigned ad placements to minimize accidental clicks
   - Implemented proper test device configuration
   - Added AdMob mediation to diversify revenue sources
   - Set up comprehensive analytics (Firebase Analytics)
   - Will monitor traffic patterns daily going forward
   
5. REQUEST:
   If possible, could you please share any specific dates or patterns you detected? This would help me identify and fix the root cause to ensure compliance.

I am committed to maintaining a high-quality user experience and adhering to all AdMob policies.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[你的名字]
